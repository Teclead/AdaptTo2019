# Sample AEM project template

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* ui.content: contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps
* ui.tests: Java bundle containing JUnit tests that are executed server-side. This bundle is not to be deployed onto production.
* ui.launcher: contains glue code that deploys the ui.tests bundle (and dependent bundles) to the server and triggers the remote JUnit execution

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

* unit test in core: this show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To test, execute:

    mvn clean test

* server-side integration tests: this allows to run unit-like tests in the AEM-environment, ie on the AEM server. To test, execute:

    mvn clean verify -PintegrationTests

* client-side Hobbes.js tests: JavaScript-based browser-side tests that verify browser-side behavior. To test:

    in the browser, open the page in 'Developer mode', open the left panel and switch to the 'Tests' tab and find the generated 'MyName Tests' and run them.

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:

## Frontend Build 

### Features

* Full TypeScript, ES6 and ES5 support (with applicable Webpack wrappers).
* TypeScript and JavaScript linting (using a TSLint ruleset â€“ to be refined).
* ES5 output, for legacy browser support.
* Globbing
    * No need to add imports anywhere.
    * All JS and CSS files can now be added to each component (best practice is under /clientlib/js or /clientlib/(s)css)
    * No .content.xml or js.txt/css.txt files needed as everything is run through Webpack
    * The globber pulls in all JS files under the /component/ folder. Webpack allows CSS/SCSS files to be chained in via JS files. They are pulled in through the two entry points, sites.js and vendors.js.
    * The only file consumed by AEM is the output files site.js and site.css in /clientlib-site as well as dependencies.js and dependencies.css in /clientlib-dependencies
* Chunks
    * Main (site js/css)
    * Vendors (dependencies js/css)
* Full Sass/Scss support (Sass is compiled to CSS via Webpack).

### Installation

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v10+), globally. This will also install `npm`.
2. Navigate to `ui.frontend` in your project and run `npm install`.

### Usage

The following npm scripts drive the frontend workflow:

* `npm run dev` - full build with JS optimization disabled (tree shaking, etc) and source maps enabled and CSS optimization disabled.
* `npm run prod` - full build with JS optimization enabled (tree shaking, etc), source maps disabled and CSS optimization enabled.

### Output

#### General

* **Site** - `site.js` and `site.css` are created in a `clientlib-site` folder.
* **Dependencies** - `dependencies.js` and `dependencies.css` are created in a `clientlib-dependencies` folder.

#### JavaScript

* **Optimization** - for production builds, all JS that is not being used or
called is removed.

#### CSS

* **Autoprefixing** - all CSS is run through a prefixer and any properties that require prefixing will automatically have those added in the CSS.
* **Optimization** - at post, all CSS is run through an optimizer (cssnano) which normalizes it according to the following default rules:
    * Reduces CSS calc expression wherever possible, ensuring both browser compatibility and compression.
    * Converts between equivalent length, time and angle values. Note that by default, length values are not converted.
    * Removes comments in and around rules, selectors & declarations.
    * Removes duplicated rules, at-rules and declarations. Note that this only works for exact duplicates.
    * Removes empty rules, media queries and rules with empty selectors, as they do not affect the output.
    * Merges adjacent rules by selectors and overlapping property/value pairs.
    * Ensures that only a single `@charset` is present in the CSS file and moves it to the top of the document.
    * Replaces the CSS initial keyword with the actual value, when the resulting output is smaller.
    * Compresses inline SVG definitions with SVGO.
* **Cleaning** - explicit clean task for wiping out the generated CSS, JS and Map files on demand.
* **Source Mapping** - development build only.

### Notes

* Utilizes dev-only and prod-only webpack config files that share a common config file. This way the development and production settings can be tweaked independently.
